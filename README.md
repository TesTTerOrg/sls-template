# Welcome to sls-template

In order to use this template you'll need to have serverless globally installed in your device or just install it through running `npm install serverless`.

After you have serverless installed you can continue.

Wherever you want your new project to be run the following command to create a directory with your template. The name of that directory and the name in `service` of the serverless.yml file will be whatever you input after `--path`

`serverless create --template-url https://github.com/TesTTerOrg/sls-template --path projectName`
